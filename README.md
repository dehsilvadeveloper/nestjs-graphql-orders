## Objectives

* Use separeted config files to define options of some parts of the application, avoiding direct access to environment variables
* Use GraphQL with **code-first** approach using decorators
* Enable or disable **GraphQL Playground** based on option of config file
* Use SQLite for database type
* Use Prisma for database modelling and migration
* Seed initial data on the database
* Use modular approach to organize logic
* Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to transport groups of data between the application layers and to validate input data
* Reuse DTO for create order on the DTO for update order using PartialType and OmitType
* Use **transform** decorator to format dates of entity classes only when they are serialized to JSON
* Use **interceptors** to convert errors to exceptions
