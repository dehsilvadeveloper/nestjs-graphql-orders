## GraphQL

### The code-first approach

**Code-first** or **Code-only** is an approach where you only need to write the resolvers for the GraphQL server and a build tool can compile the schema and SDL based on the types or annotations included in the code. This is more common in type-safe languages, such as graphql-kotlin, where you can run reflections against source code, however, it can be used by any GraphQL server language.

### Playground

The application serves the GraphQL Playground on the following url:

`http://localhost:3000/graphql`

You can use the examples available on the topic **Examples of GraphQL queries** on the Playground to test the api.

### Examples of GraphQL queries

Soon.
