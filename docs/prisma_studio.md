## Using Prisma Studio

The **Prisma Studio** is a simple tabular interface where you can quickly have a look at the data of your local database and check if your app is working correctly. It also allow you to interact with your data with full CRUD functionality.

If you want to use the Studio, run the following script:

```shell
npm run prisma:studio
```

This will load the Studio based on the database that you have provided and open its interface on the browser so that you can interact with the data.

If you want to stop the Studio, use the following key combination on the terminal:

`ctrl + c`

This will stop the Prisma Studio.
